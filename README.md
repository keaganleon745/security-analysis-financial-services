# Comparing PASTA and STRIDE Threat Modeling on Bank of America's Security
Bank of America and other financial institutions face frequent cyberattacks each year, threatening both data integrity and quality of service. STRIDE and PASTA are two widely used threat modeling frameworks that help identify and mitigate these risks, though they differ in efficiency and approach. Comparing these tools is essential to determine the most effective strategy for securing critical systems.

# Background
Bank of America is known for being one of the most secure banking institutions, serving nearly 67 million customers across 35 countries. Nevertheless, it remains a frequent target of security threats that can jeopardize both its commitments and customer trust. The table below highlights STRIDE and PASTAâ€”two threat modeling frameworks used to identify, categorize, prioritize, and mitigate such threats.Bank of America is known for being one of the most secure banking institutions, serving nearly 67 million customers across 35 countries.

Both frameworks use different strategies, leading to varying responses that can impact a company's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The goal of this project is to analyze Bank of America's security using the PASTA and STRIDE threat modeling tools to compare the effectiveness of each approach.
